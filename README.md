update 2024-10-19 morning
- solved all problems with the script, runs successfully
- need to find better way to automate on a schedule

update 2024-10-18 afternoon
 - script is ready but adding a new row does not copy in the formula from below
  - might need to add the formula from the script/using gspread
 - tried task scheduler but got locked out because of the OWNER/Chris user <> microsoft user
  - will probably need a new way to schedule the script
